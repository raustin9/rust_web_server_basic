# Basic Rust Web Server
This is a very basic implimentation of a multithreaded web server based on the documentation in the rust book.
It can load multiple file types, but it is not powerful at all and is best served as a proof of concept and a learning tool to get used
to async io with tokio and other rust concurrency items.
